dwm - dynamic window manager (olive edition)
============================================
My build of dwm, which adds features that make it quite possibly
the greatest window manager of all time, while still being pretty
minimal. It's so good that I'm probably gonna be using this for 
the rest of my life. Thank you suckless <3

You might wanna read the original README for dwm because this one
is pretty useless.

This is my first time using git so please excuse any stupidities.


"features"
----------
- Added a few new layouts, all of which have gaps and are mapped to the keyboard in a fairly consistent manner
- Transparency patch because this stuff is important
- Objectively perfect keybindings


Configuration
-------------
Edit the source code (mainly config.h or config.def.h) and recompile!

Note: manually add layout patches to layouts.c
